I've tried to choose assignments that represent three categories: digital skills development; writing skills development; experiential education. In general I link to the assignment's natural online habitat, but in a few places the materials were produced for offline consumption, in which case I have linked to a PDF.

## Digital Skills {#digital-skills}

-   "Advanced Topics README" from HIS393. This is the general introduction to the final three assignments in _Digital History_, which are designed so as to allow students to convert them into a portfolio and personal website. [The online repository](https://github.com/DigitalHistory/advanced-topics) has links to the individual project that are described in the text.
-   "DOM and Data README" from HIS393. In this assignment, students learn to perform basic web page manipulations with JavaScript. [The full assignment repository](https://github.com/DigitalHistory/03-js-dom) contains the actual coding problems and reflection questions students are asked to perform. You may be interested in the heavily-scaffolded code examples, e.g., [in part 1](https://github.com/DigitalHistory/03-js-dom/blob/d52d1db65f706dc40a5e4817106d6eba06750cef/Part1/01-data-to-rows.js#L113).
