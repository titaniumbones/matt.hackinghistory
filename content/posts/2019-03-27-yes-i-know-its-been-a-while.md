This is an ancient WordPress blog which I at one point hoped would be a more comprehensive representation of my activity online. I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated with WordPress, though, and while there are excellent tools to work in the framework from e.g. Emacs, I&#8217;d still rather maintain a simple plain-text static site. However&#8230; self-promotion never seems to bubble to the top of my to-do list. This notice is just to say: SOME DAY you will see a Hugo or Jekyll site here, and when that day comes ,perhaps I&#8217;ll start blogging actively again. Thanks for dropping by!
