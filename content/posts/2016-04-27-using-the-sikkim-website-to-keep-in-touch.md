OK, we&rsquo;re getting down to the wire. This post is for the Sikkim trip students&#x2026;. 

I know most of you will keep in touch with friends and family via Facebook & other social media. However, I&rsquo;m hoping that we will also use the group website as a way to keep in touch while we&rsquo;re gone. As you know, I&rsquo;ve set the site up as a major part of our intellectual output for this project, and yo all have accounts that should let you write and publish blog posts & webpages. 

Here are just a few short tips on how to use the site. I&rsquo;m hoping those of you who are familiar with WordPress can help the others. 

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orgheadline1">
    Getting Started
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
    <p>
      Use your username and password to get into the site <a href="http://sikkim.hackinghistory.ca/wp-admin/">at the admin/login page</a>. To create a new journal entry, go to Posts/New (or tap the <code>+</code> button in the top menu. Compose your message in the editor box, add pictures using the &ldquo;add media&rsquo; button in the editor toolbar, press &rdquo;Publish&ldquo;, and you&rsquo;re done.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orgheadline2">
    Location Data
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
    <p>
      Since we&rsquo;re thinking of this as &ldquo;place-based&rdquo; education, location data is pretty important to us. You can add three kinds of location information to your post (underneath the editor box):
    </p>
    
    <dl class="org-dl">
      <dt>
        GPX Tracks
      </dt>
      
      <dd>
        These are recordings of where you&rsquo;ve been (discussed in my last post). If you attach one of these in the &ldquo;GPX File&rdquo; upload box, it will display in your post (but not in the list of all the posts&#x2026;). We&rsquo;ll use these a lot when we&rsquo;re in Sikkim.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>
        KML FIles
      </dt>
      
      <dd>
        There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff these can do, but the main reason I included them is that in some cases they can be easier to export than gpx tracks.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>
        Co-ordinates
      </dt>
      
      <dd>
        You can use this to indicate where you are in the moment that you&rsquo;re writing your post. This is what will show up in the &ldquo;archive&rdquo; and &ldquo;our journey&rdquo; pages (yo can look at the test pages for examples of how it will look).
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>
      I strongly encourage you to use the geodata options here! It&rsquo;ll help our site out a lot.

  <h2 id="orgheadline3">
    Featured Image
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
    <p>
      You&rsquo;ll notice that each post has one special image associated with it, that is used as a packground image in a couple of places. This is the &ldquo;featured image&rdquo;, which you set in a box on the lower right of the writing interface page (or, if you&rsquo;re using your phone, just really far down in the interface). I&rsquo;d really like it if every post had a featured image, so try to choose a good one!

  <h2 id="orgheadline4">
    Showing a post on the &ldquo;Our Journey&rdquo; Page
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline4">
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Journey&rdquo; is, as it were, the &ldquo;official&rdquo; record of our trip. Each day one or two of us will write a special post about the day&rsquo;s events; it&rsquo;s expected to be perhaps a little more substantive or public-facing than your regular travel diary. You can move a post into the &ldquo;Our Journey&rdquo; feed by adding the &ldquo;Our Journey&rdquo; category &#x2013; in the &ldquo;Category&rdquo; box.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Youu may also notice the &ldquo;Tags&rdquo; box &#x2013; we an talk later about how to make use of tags on the site.

      See yo all in India!
