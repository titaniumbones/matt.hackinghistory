I&rsquo;ve just learned that the being I thought was a cute dancing penguin is in fact [an evil alien creature bent on destruction and domination][1]. This creature has invaded a number of projects that I&rsquo;m a part of, including [Civic Tech][2], [EDGI][3], and my classes [&ldquo;Technologies for Democracy&rdquo;][4] and &ldquo;[Digital History][5]&rdquo;. I can only assume that these projects have a hitherto-unrealized importance to the survival of the planet. <figure>

Eternal Vigilance!
