Most of my online life takes place on Github; I have social media accounts but they bore me.  Look for me here:  

-   [Personal Github account](https://github.com/titaniumbones/): personal coding projects, as well as materials for courses that don't require their own extensive infrastructure. Also, of course, stray forks of projects I've submitted patches to etc. And a lot of Emacs stuff!
-   [Digital History](https://github.com/DigitalHistory) My most active GH organization; repositories for course materials and hackable infrastructure to support HIS393, as well as a few other projects that have accidentally slipped into the organization
-   [Hacking History Organization](https://github.com/HackingHistory): infra for HIS455, though less is required for this course.
-   [EDGI Github Organization](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving): the github work I'm most proud of; established under great pressures during a historically unprecedented moment in late 2016/early 2017. Still houses all the code for the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/).
